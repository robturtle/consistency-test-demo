This parsing library is just for fun, not much related to the main purpose of the project.

I just got surprised by the existed parsing libraries which either presumes a strict format (like `CLI`)
or reject to bring some complex concept such as "mutually exclusive options" (like `args4j`).

So I wrote this humble buggy implementation tailored for our very needs, whose functions can completely 
implemented via carefully reading document of `CLI` or `args4j`. But I just prefer doing it in my way.
